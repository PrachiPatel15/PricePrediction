# PricePrediction
> Here, i've build a real estate price prediction project which predicts a house price in Banglore.

>> This Data Science project strolls through bit by bit course of how to assemble a land value expectation site.We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
